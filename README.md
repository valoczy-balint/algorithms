# Algorithms and data structures

In this repo I practise some algorithms and data structures. 

Most of them are probably not optimal as I was focused on learning and having fun while doing it.

The challenges are from leetcode and hackerrank, those should be pretty optimal since the site verified them.

# Requirements

Some of these are written in Kotlin, others are in Java. So you will need a JRE to run them. 

I just ran the tests in IntelliJ since that's easiest during development but you can also use the included gradle wrapper
```
./gradlew test --parallel
```
